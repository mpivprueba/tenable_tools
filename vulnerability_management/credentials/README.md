# Credentials Module

The Credentials module functions as the centralized authentication credentials manager for security scans, enabling secure storage, management, and utilization of credentials for authenticated scanning in [Tenable.io](https://www.tenable.com/products/vulnerability-management).
---

## Purpose

This module provides comprehensive credential management capabilities for Tenable.io, allowing security teams to:

* Securely store and manage authentication credentials for various systems

* Enable authenticated scanning for deeper vulnerability assessment

* Support privilege escalation for comprehensive security evaluation

* Maintain credential lifecycle management (create, read, update, delete)

## Requirements

This module depends on the following Python libraries (already included in requirements.txt):

requests
python-dotenv

---

## Install them with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Environment variables

The module requires API credentials and configuration stored in a .env file at the project root:

ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

BASE_URL=https://cloud.tenable.com

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Credential Creation and Management

**File: create_credentials.py**

The create_credentials.py module provides secure credential creation with privilege escalation support:

def create_credential(name, username, password, escalation_method, escalation_account, escalation_password, bin_directory):
    """
    Creates new SSH credentials in Tenable.io with comprehensive privilege escalation options
    Supports multiple escalation methods: sudo, su, su+sudo, dzdo, pbrun
    Securely transmits credentials via HTTPS to Tenable.io cloud storage
    """

### 2. Credential Modification

**File: edit_credentials.py**

The edit_credentials.py module enables partial or complete credential updates:

def edit_credential(uuid, name, username, password, escalation_method, escalation_account, escalation_password, bin_directory):
    """
    Modifies existing credentials while maintaining UUID integrity
    Supports selective updates - only changed fields need to be provided
    Maintains credential relationships with existing scans and policies
    """

### 3. Credential Deletion

**File: delete_credentials.py**

The delete_credentials.py module handles secure credential removal:

def delete_credential(uuid):
    """
    Permanently removes credentials from Tenable.io
    Provides operation confirmation and error handling
    Ensures clean removal from the credential inventory
    """

### 4. Credential Inventory Management

**File:  list_credentials.py**

The list_credentials.py module displays all registered credentials:

def list_credentials():
    """
    Retrieves and displays comprehensive credential information including:
    - Credential name and UUID
    - Credential type and associated user
    - Privilege escalation method
    - Integration status with scans and policies
    """

### 5. Credential Type Discovery

**File: list_credential_types.py**

The list_credential_types.py module provides complete credential type structure:

def list_credential_types():
    """
    Displays complete hierarchical structure of available credential types
    Shows detailed category information and type specifications
    Essential for development and integration planning
    """
### 6. Credential Type Names

**File: list_credential_names.py**

The list_credential_names.py module provides human-readable type names:

def list_credential_names():
    """
    Returns readable names of all supported credential types
    Facilitates user-friendly credential type selection
    Supports internationalization and localization needs
    """

### 7. Credential Type ID Extraction

**File: extract_credential_ids.py**

The extract_credential_ids.py module extracts unique credential type identifiers:

def extract_credential_ids():
    """
    Extracts and displays unique IDs for all available credential types
    Provides mapping between type IDs and visible names
    Essential for API integration and automation scripts
    """

### 8. Credential Configuration Templates

**File: show_type_config.py**

The show_type_config.py module displays type-specific configuration requirements:

def show_type_config(type_id):
    """
    Shows expected configuration structure for specific credential types including:
    - Required and optional fields
    - Valid values for enumeration fields
    - Field descriptions and usage examples
    - Privilege escalation options and dependencies
    """

# Getting Started

### Step-by-Step: Opening Terminal and Navigating to Your Project

Step 1: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell

* Press Windows + R keys simultaneously

* Type cmd for Command Prompt or powershell for PowerShell

* Press Enter

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

You need to navigate to the folder where you downloaded or cloned the Tenable Tools project. Replace the example path with your actual project location:

cd "C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\PROJECT\tenable_tools\vulnerability_management"

Examples of actual paths:

#### If you saved it in Documents:
cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\tenable_tools\vulnerability_management"

#### If you saved it on Desktop:
cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\tenable_tools\vulnerability_management"

#### If you saved it in a different drive:
cd "D:\Projects\tenable_tools\vulnerability_management"


### Step 3: Verify Your Location
After running the cd command, your terminal should show something like:

PS C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\tenable_tools\vulnerability_management>


### Step 4: Activate Virtual Environment (if created)

..\venv\Scripts\activate


### Step 5: Verify You Can Run Commands

python main.py --help

## Example workflow

## Notes
* Credentials are securely stored in Tenable.io and can be reused across scans.

* Handle sensitive values (e.g., passwords) carefully; never commit them to version control.

* If you delete a credential, it cannot be recovered.
