# Credentials Module

The credentials module manages authentication credentials used for scans in Tenable.io.
It allows you to securely create, list, and delete credentials through the Tenable.io API.

---

## Files in this module

- `create_credentials.py` → Creates new credentials in Tenable.io.
- `list_credentials.py` → Lists all available credentials in your Tenable.io account.
- `scan_edelete_credentials.py` → Deletes a credential by its ID.

---

## Requirements

This module depends on the following Python libraries (already included in `requirements.txt`):

requests
python-dotenv

---

## Install them with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Environment variables

The module requires API credentials and configuration stored in a .env file at the project root:

ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
BASE_URL=https://cloud.tenable.com

Usage guide

### 1. Create Credentials
File: create_credentials.py

code in main.py

from credentials.create_credentials import create_credentials

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cred_id = create_credentials(
        name="Linux SSH",
        username="admin",
        password="password123",
        auth_type="SSH"
    )
    print(f"Credential created with ID: {cred_id}")

* Input: 

name (str): Credential name

username (str): Account username

password (str): Account password

auth_type (str): Authentication type (e.g., "SSH", "Windows")

* Output: cred_id (unique identifier of the created credential).

### 2. List Credentials
File: list_credentials.py

from credentials.list_credentials import list_credentials

if __name__ == "__main__":
    credentials = list_credentials()
    print("Available credentials:")
    for cred in credentials:
        print(f"ID: {cred['id']}, Name: {cred['name']}")

* Input: None
* Output: A list of credentials (id, name, type)

### 3. Delete Credentials
File: delete_credentials.py

from credentials.delete_credentials import delete_credentials

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = delete_credentials(cred_id=1234)
    print(result)

* Input: cred_id (integer) → ID of the credential to delete.
* Output: Success message confirming deletion.

---

## Example workflow

1. Create a new credential:

cred_id = create_credentials("Windows Admin", "administrator", "P@ssw0rd", "Windows")

2. List all credentials:

list_credentials()

3. Delete Credentials

Delete Credentials

## Notes
* Credentials are securely stored in Tenable.io and can be reused across scans.

* Handle sensitive values (e.g., passwords) carefully; never commit them to version control.

* If you delete a credential, it cannot be recovered.
